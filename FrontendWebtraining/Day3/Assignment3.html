    <h2>About The Book</h2>
    <p>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" is a bestselling personal finance book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki, first published in 1997. It has become one of the most popular financial books of all time, known for its simple yet powerful lessons about money, wealth, and investing.</p>
     <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
     <p>I love Rich Dad Poor Dad because it completely changed the way I think about money and success. It taught me that true wealth comes from building assets, not just earning a salary, and showed me the importance of financial educationâ€”something school never taught. The simple yet powerful lessons inspired me to take control of my financial future, think like an investor, and make smarter choices in life.</p>
